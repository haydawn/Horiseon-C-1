# Horiseon - Code Refactor

## Description 
Horiseon Marketing agency has hired me to refractor their existing website code to make it more accessible and seo optimised. 


## Horiseon's existing website 

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, cards with text, a sidebar, and a footer section.](Assets/01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png)


## How I approached this Project
I wanted ensure this website met accessibility standards without changing look of the existing site. 

In order to achieve this, I did the following:

* Added Semantic HTML elements throughout the source code
* Made sure the HTML elements followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Added `alt` attributes to Image and icon elements 
* Made sure the Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Added a concise and descriptive Title
* Double checked all links to ensure they are working correctly
* Reworked the CSS style sheet to make it more efficient by consolidating selectors and properties and organising them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
* Included comments before each element or section of the page


### Improvements Suggessions
Although the website is now more accessible, I believe further improvments can be made to enhance it further. Below are my suggessions. 

* Ensure that all interactive elements can be accessed and navigated using a keyboard. 
* Ensure your website is responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
