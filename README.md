# Horiseon - Code Refactor

## Description 
Horiseon Marketing agency has hired me to refractor their existing website code to make it more accessible and seo optimised. 


## Horiseon's existing website 

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, cards with text, a sidebar, and a footer section](Assets/01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png)


## How I Approached this Project
I wanted ensure this website met accessibility standards without changing look of the existing site. 

In order to achieve this, I did the following:

* Validated and corrected all links for proper functionality
* Organised CSS properties to follow the semantic structure of HTML elements
* Integrated alt attributes for Image and icon elements
* Implemented semantic HTML elements across the codebase to enhance structure and logic
* Reworked the CSS style sheet for efficiency by consolidating selectors and properties
* Ensured the Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Added a concise and descriptive Title
* Made sure the HTML elements followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Included comments before each element or section on the page for clarity and ease of understanding


### Improvements Suggessions
Although the website is now more accessible, I believe further improvments can be made to enhance it further. Below are my suggessions. 

* Ensure that all interactive elements can be accessed and navigated using a keyboard. 
* Ensure your website is responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
